### What are the future features?

#### Additions to already created programs.

##### update

The ability to process .md files of names other than README.md where README.md acts as the index file a file with the name of update.md would create an update.html file.

#### New programs to be added to ghmd-ccs

##### I dub thee create-templates

I plan on working on a way to read a index.html file and create an appropriate template structure that is easily updated.

The structure will contain something like this.

file | Purpose of the file.
----|----
index-template.html | This is what holds the base html.
css.html | The css loading definitions.
sidebar.html | The html for a side bar if any.
downloads.html | The top download menu of the site.
title.html | The title of the site.
header.html | The header information of the site.
