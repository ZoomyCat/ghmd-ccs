# Table of ghmd-ccs information.

command | created | completed | used by user | what it does or will do
----|----|----|----|----
update| yes | no | yes | Creates a index.html file using a  template html file for the body of the document and README.md files for the main content. I would like to have this create an index.html file for a README.md and for any other file with an extension of .md it will create a .html file of the same name.
ghmd2html | yes | yes | no | This file does some checking and some of the magic behind update. update was created to be the front end to this program.
update-templates | no | no | yes | Creates the template structure if one does not exist from an index.html file generated by the gitub automated site generator. If a template structure does exist it will create a new index.html based on changes made to the template structure.
