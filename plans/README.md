### What feature is next?

I plan on working on a way to read a index.html file and create an appropriate template structure that is easily updated.

file | Purpose of the file.
----|----
index-template.html | This is what holds the base html.
loadcss.html | The css loading definitions.
sidebar.html | The html for a side bar if any.
topmenu.html | The top menu of the site.
title.html | The title of the site.
header.html | The header information of the site.
