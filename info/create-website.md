# Steps to creating a website on GitHub.

1. If you do not already have a username.github.io repository ( you need one ) or if you need to create a repository website you should check out the [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) GitHub help documentation.
  * The repository name will be used as the project name during website generation.
  * The description will be used as the tagline for the website.
  * To save time input the most relevent data the first time.

2. Use the GitHub [The Automatic Page Generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator/#the-automatic-page-generator) to generate yourself a template website.
  * Update the Project Name and Tagline as desired.
  * Update the body section to contain `Template.` only.
  ### Important!
  Having the body section say `Template.` gives ghmd-ccs the information needed on where to put the main content from the markdown files.
