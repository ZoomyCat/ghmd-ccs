## How to update your website?

Updating your website actually recreates every html file in the website.

You can run an update like this:
```
ghmd-ccs/update
```

You've now recreated all of the html files from the markdown files.

The way git keeps track of files only files that have been changed will be uploaded back to GitHub.

The next thing you want to do is add all changed files, Commit the changes. Then push the changes to github.

Your site has now been updated.
