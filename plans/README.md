### What are the future features?

#### Additions to already created programs.

##### update

The ability to process .md files of names other than README.md where README.md acts as the index file a file with the name of update.md would create an update.html file.

#### New programs to be added to ghmd-ccs

##### I dub thee update-templates

I plan on working on a way to read a index.html file and create an appropriate template structure that is easily updated.
